Robert Simmons

My name is Robert Simmons. I am creating a personal landing page for myself, and for the company I am starting. I would like help from anyone who has experience with coding html, css, JavaScript and Python.
Right now I'm trying to write an html doc that is compatible for mobile phones along with desktop.
